\begin{abstract} 
Carnatic Music is a sacred art form hailing from South India in the 18th century. This form of music has two main aspects: “swara” or the melody and “laya” or rhythm. In this report, we investigate how we can classify the “laya” or rhythmic aspect from audio samples of Carnatic Music. Specifically, we seek to identify the “tala” or meter of the sample. We use the Carnatic Music dataset from the University of Pompeau Fabra. We attempt to use the 1D CNN, 2D CNN, RNN with Long Short term memory cells, and the Autoencoder (for denoising). This report provides our baseline results as well as the directions we plan to take this project.
\end{abstract} 


\section{Final Submission}

Your final submission will consist of two deliverables:  (1) a final report, and (2) a set of summary slides. Please check the course website for the appropriate deadlines. 

\subsection{Final Report}

Your final project report can be at most 4 pages long (include all text, appendices, figures, and anything else), with 1 additional page that can contain nothing but references, and must be written in the provided \LaTeX\ template. If you did this work in collaboration with someone else, or if someone else (such as another professor) had advised you on this work, your report must fully acknowledge their contributions. 

At a minimum, your final report must describe the problem/application and motivation, survey related work, discuss your approach, and explain your results/conclusions/impact of your project. It should include enough detail such that someone else can reproduce your method and results. You are also required to provide a link to a github repository where your code is stored. You may look at previous projects or papers from the list in section 2 to get an idea of what should be included in your project report. You will likely end up with a better report if you start by writing a 6-7 page report and then edit it down to 4 pages of well-written and concise prose. Keep in mind if you have an exciting and novel idea for this project, we can extend your work and submit it to an appropriate machine learning conference. 

Also, your report must also include a figure that graphically summarizes the main components of your project (e.g., your approach and how it relates to the application, etc.). Such a figure makes your paper much more accessible by providing a visual counterpart to the text. Developing such a short and clear figure can be quite time-consuming; so plan wisely and feel free to consult your advisor during this process or me. I will be reviewing your papers and give you my feedback so you can adjust some of its contents and send back a revised paper that will be posted online on the course website after the class ends. It is preferred to display your work online so other people can read about each other's work. If you are okay with having your final report posted online, be sure you give us explicit permission when you submit, as described below.

\subsection{Final Poster}

In addition to the final report, you are also required to prepare a poster overview of your project. Details on the poster are available in the project description.

\section{Optional Suggestions for Your Paper and Formatting Guidance} 

\subsection{Figures}
 
You may want to include figures in the paper to help readers visualize
your approach and your results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
not appear on a gray background.

Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
figure; instead, be sure to include a caption describing your figure.

You may float figures to the top or
bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment {\tt figure*} in \LaTeX), but always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic'' 
environments to format pseudocode. These require 
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and 
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package. 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:example} shows an example. 

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{Bubble Sort}
   \label{alg:example}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$} 
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
 
\subsection{Tables} 
 
You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like 
figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively. 
However, place the title {\it above\/} the table, as in 
Table~\ref{sample-table}.
% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing 
% above and below tabular lines. 

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Classification accuracies for naive Bayes and flexible 
Bayes on various data sets.}
\label{sample-table}
\vskip 0.15in
\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{sc}
\begin{tabular}{lcccr}
\hline
\abovespace\belowspace
Data set & Naive & Flexible & Better? \\
\hline
\abovespace
Breast    & 95.9$\pm$ 0.2& 96.7$\pm$ 0.2& $\surd$ \\
Cleveland & 83.3$\pm$ 0.6& 80.0$\pm$ 0.6& $\times$\\
Glass2    & 61.9$\pm$ 1.4& 83.8$\pm$ 0.7& $\surd$ \\
Credit    & 74.8$\pm$ 0.5& 78.3$\pm$ 0.6&         \\
Horse     & 73.3$\pm$ 0.9& 69.7$\pm$ 1.0& $\times$\\
Meta      & 67.1$\pm$ 0.6& 76.5$\pm$ 0.5& $\surd$ \\
Pima      & 75.1$\pm$ 0.6& 73.9$\pm$ 0.5&         \\
\belowspace
Vehicle   & 44.9$\pm$ 0.6& 61.5$\pm$ 0.4& $\surd$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{sc}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.1in
\end{table}

Tables contain textual material that can be typeset, as contrasted 
with figures, which contain graphical material that must be drawn. 
Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
wide tables across both columns, but place two-column tables at the
top or bottom of the page.
 
\subsection{Citations and References} 

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic 
facility, use {\tt natbib.sty} and {\tt icml2014.bst} 
included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

The references at the end of this document give examples for journal
articles \cite{Samuel59}, conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books \cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, 
technical reports \cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}. 

Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
information (e.g., page numbers).

\section*{Acknowledgments} 
 
If you did this work in collaboration with someone else, or if someone else (such as another professor) had advised you on this work, your report must fully acknowledge their contributions. If you received external help or assistance on this project, you must cite these sources here in the acknowledgements section.  If you do not have anything to list in this section, write simply ``None.''
